question: "What's a simple way to find out when you can retire?"
overview: "Young professionals treat retirement as a distant, unattainable goal. However, they donâ€™t realize how close financial freedom can be with aggressive investing and mindful spending. With the help of smart defaults and assumptions, Abound boils financial independence down to a simple equation, and helps users track their path to freedom."
