    question: "What's a simple way to find out when you can retire?"
    overview: "Young professionals treat retirement as a distant, unattainable goal. However, they don’t realize how close financial freedom can be with aggressive investing and mindful spending. With the help of smart defaults and assumptions, Abound boils financial independence down to a simple equation, and helps users track their path to freedom."

        caption: "We want to bring aspiration and optimism to the traditionally sterile and even painful topic of money. Implied is the hope that the feeling of abundance is attainable for everyone."

      - caption_title: Landing page
        caption: "Wanted a simple, clear description of the Abound benefit and service. “Leave your job...” is provocative enough to catch attention and pique interest for visitors, and it also filters for our target users who are passionate about using money tools to improve their lives."
        screenshot_url: "../../assets/abound-step-2.png"
      - caption_title: Input view
        caption: "Clean, focused input to not overwhelm the user with complexity (unlike many personal finance tools). We went for the minimum amount of clutter. We used a custom Angular directive to constrain the input to dollars, as well as Angular animation to smooth the transition between steps."
        screenshot_url: "../../assets/abound-step-3.png"
      - caption_title: Output view
        caption: "We wanted to give primacy to the number of years until you can retire, which is the main value of Abound. Hence the centrality and contrast. Below there’s a peek at the graph to give explanation to how we arrived at that number, and the opportunity to try different input values and view its impact. We used D3 for the graphing component, and our Angular app triggers a recalculation and redraw whenever inputs are changed anywhere in the app."

      - caption_title: Actions
        caption: "So now the user knows how far away they are from financial independence: now what? I wanted to create a dynamic browsing experience of content that can reduces the number of years until retirement. We chose an image-based approach to communicate diversity of options and preview the products that we endorse."

qb_news:
    title: "QuickBooks news"
    question: "How do we get customers to try new features?"
    overview: "Awareness and engagement with new features and product changes was pretty low in QuickBooks. We set out to define a pattern for messages that alerted customer to relevant product updates each month."
    hero_image_path: "../../assets/qb-news-title.png"
    steps:
      - caption_title: Concept explorations and feedback
        caption: "After doing some competitive research, I sketched out a variety of concepts for messaging to prompt the team to grapple with some big questions: how interruptive should we be? Which content belongs here? QuickBooks launches many things frequently: what belongs in our message?"
        screenshot_url: "../../assets/qb-news-step-1.jpg"
      - caption_title: "HTML/CSS/JS prototypes"
        caption: "I wanted to get a feel for clickability, color, and motion, so I quickly coded up some prototypes of the likely candidates after the initial feedback. I used an Angular framework I built that leverages the real UI components of QuickBooks. This helped the team really consider if content categorization mattered or not, helped us get a feel for a real life experience, and resulted in a seamless transition to our developers."
        screenshot_url: "../../assets/qb-news-step-2.png"
      - caption_title: "Final (v1)"
        caption: "We chose to go with a list view for to remain flexible for future unforeseen content. A subtle, unifying graphic conceptualizes each message and focuses the user on reading the header text."

qb_expenses:
    title: "QuickBooks expenses"
    question: "How can we eliminate redundant tasks in accounting?"
    overview: "Reconciling raw bank transaction data with accounting books often requires manual, repetitive work. Our goal was to enable customers to set up automated rules for performing the cleanup on certain transactions that match certain criteria, and make it useful to both accountants and entrepreneurs so love QuickBooks even more and stick with us."
    hero_image_path: "../../assets/qb-expenses-title.png"
    steps:
      - caption_title: "The problem"
        caption: "Bank transactions are often imported into QuickBooks without an accounting category. QuickBooks does its best to auto-categorize these transactions, but sometimes the bank data isn’t structured or clean enough, which requires manual cleanup that can become tedious and time-consuming for our customers."
        screenshot_url: "../../assets/qb-expenses-step-1.png"
      - caption_title: "Rule creation"
        caption: "Setting up logical criteria and triggered actions can become complex for the non-technical. As you see above, I selected a readable flowing form model, so the programmatic functionality reads how customers would speak it. It also progressively discloses more complex functionality like using multiple conditions and splitting transactions, delivering a simple flow to those with a simple use case (which were most of our customers, as we learned from customer research)."
        screenshot_url: "../../assets/qb-expenses-step-2.png"
      - caption_title: "More complex use case"
        caption: "The design expands functionality for multiple criteria rows and splitting a transaction. This power functionality is hidden until the user indicates they need it, for which we gave clear affordances, while balancing it against keeping things accessible for non-technical users."
        screenshot_url: "../../assets/qb-expenses-step-3.png"
      - caption_title: "Importing rules"
        caption: "The challenge here was to map fields from a raw spreadsheet into the known fields of the current company. I chose a side-by-side layout to emphasize that comparison."
        screenshot_url: "../../assets/qb-expenses-step-4.png"
      - caption_title: "Output"
        caption: "When rules are added, bank transactions that match the criteria are processed, and we apply the green badge to set them apart. This calls attention to how the transaction was processed, and links the user back into their rules if they want to edit something."

qb_onboarding:
    title: "QuickBooks onboarding"
    question: "How can we make it easier to start running your business finances?"
    overview: "Entrepreneurs that are new to accounting and QuickBooks often don’t know the first fews steps in getting up and running with each major feature. Our goal was to deepen engagement with QuickBooks payroll, customer management, vendor management, and banking, resulting in higher conversion from trial to subscription."
    hero_image_path: "../../assets/qb-onboarding-title.png"
    steps:
      - caption_title: "The problem with the old version"
        caption: "New users are dropped into the full functionality of QuickBooks Payroll without any instructions or even knowing the benefit. Unfortunately, this was a common pattern across the QuickBooks product for major features. Our suspicion was that this 'front-door' was ripe for raising conversion rates, which would have a huge impact on overall conversion, engagement, and retention."
        screenshot_url: "../../assets/qb-onboarding-step-1.png"
      - caption_title: "Problem definition"
        caption: "After conducting background investigation and doing a competitive audit, I explored a wide range of possible solutions. This helped clarify our priorities and assumptions, and exposed important technical constraints early on. Should it become more of a questionnaire/interview experience to tailor the experience? Or, a stepwise task list to get going? A video or walkthrough? I considered lots of ideas."
        screenshot_url: "../../assets/qb-onboarding-step-2.png"
      - caption_title: "Narrowing down based on feedback"
        caption: "After the conceptual phase, I wanted to get a feel for hierarchy by creating a few high-fidelity mockups. We put these in front of customers as well as our internal product experts to understand if this would accomodate the onboarding use cases, like doing a non-sequential series of tasks, or handling a critical or blocking task first. This nudged us toward pseudo-task list, to reveal some value of the functionality while providing some perception of progress to mastery."
        screenshot_url: "../../assets/qb-onboarding-step-3.png"
      - caption_title: "Final"
        caption: "We ended up hiding much of the product functionality initially, and replaced it with a clear choice and guidance on the payroll workflow's very first suggested step. The setup tasks are condensed down into a short list displayed on the side, along with some education content for those not yet ready to buy."

hfa:
    title: "Hillary for America fundraising"
    question: "How can we make it easy for people to contribute to a cause they believe in?"
    overview: "As part of the fundraising tech team, I worked on a single-page application that could be tailored to a variety of fundraising initiatives. We used React, a flux architecture, and a Rails/Flask backend, with extensive automated test coverage. Key to our success was a powerful experimentation/analytics framework using Optimizely and Heap, that coordinated tightly with our email tools. Given the unique needs of a campaign, we built first for scale and performance, then really focused on speed in the final weeks to achieve the campaign's ambitious fundraising targets."
    hero_image_path: "../../assets/donation-page.png"
    steps:
      - caption_title: "What I helped build"
        caption: "(1) Paypal integration to augment the standard credit card Stripe checkout. (2) A simple, performant fail-over donation page in case the main website crashed. (3) Launched dozens of A/B tests to optimize conversion through the donation funnel. (4) Integrated the full donation application into the homepage to increase conversion."
        screenshot_url: "../../assets/donate-page-2.png"
      - caption_title: "Accomplishments"
        caption: "Our winning experiments led to significant conversion improvements, resulting in tens of millions of dollars in additional donation totals to the campaign, even besting previous campaign donation numbers."

transfix:
    title: "Transfix"
    question: "How can we make the movement of goods more efficient?"
    overview: "As a member of the front-end engineering team, I helped build tools for managing supply chain logistics. Our flagship app was built in AureliaJS, but for the demands I foresaw in our product roadmaps, I advocated for and architected a micro-app approach based on customer use case, to allow teams to move faster. The result was a brand new SaaS application for shippers built in React/Redux."
    hero_image_path: "../../assets/transfix-1.png"
    steps:
      - caption_title: "Accomplishments"
        caption: "(1) Built in automated testing to ensure code and product quality. (2) Re-architected the front-end stack by building a new SaaS application on React/Redux. (3) Re-rewrote the build system to enable continuous deployment, speeding up delivery cycles. (4) Wrote and open-sourced a plugin for our unit testing framework."

mint:
    title: "Mint car value"
    question: "How does your car impact your financial life?"
    overview: "Mint users tilt toward younger, higher-income professionals. For many, their car is their largest asset. Yet, there was no easy way on the web or in Mint to track what it was worth, outside of obsessively checking Kelley Blue Book and updating that number in Mint. So, we set out to fetch that data and track it automatically."
    hero_image_path: "../../assets/mint-title.png"
    steps:
      - caption_title: "Entry form"
        caption: "Utilizes progressive disclosure, where each field activates when the previous is entered, focusing the user on each step and preventing mistakes."
        screenshot_url: "../../assets/mint-step-1.png"
      - caption_title: "Output"
        caption: "We deliver the latest car value. The user must prepare the data for display back on their home dashboard. We make pre-fill Make and Model to reduce mandatory text entry."
        screenshot_url: "../../assets/mint-step-2.png"
      - caption_title: "Error handling"
        caption: "If the user edits the automated field, the service stops importing from Kelley Blue Book. So, we needed to warn the user when they edit this field."
        screenshot_url: "../../assets/mint-step-3.png"
      - caption_title: "Connection management"
        caption: "We enable the user to update their mileage over time for a more accurate value estimate as their car is used."
        screenshot_url: "../../assets/mint-step-4.png"
      - caption_title: "Ongoing use"
        caption: "The car appears under property on the dashboard, and is updated weekly."
